# Twitter-Influencers-Finder
a program that finds twitter influencers 

# The Problem I want to solve
online marketing and self promoting is mainstream.
not only big companies do that anymore.
therefore, i believe online marketing should be simple and effective.
the main problem - it is not.
Using google's sponsored marketing is effective only if you invest A considerable amount of money.
same goes for Facebook.

thats why i created Twitter-Influence-Finder, or "Twinfluencers".

# What is it
Instead of paying Facebook or Google, i want to pay middle-sized Twitter influencers.
A guy with += 3K followers won't take much money for promoting your product.
His 3k followers take his tweets seriously and if he will promote you product - they will use it. I tried.

so what is Twinfluencers"?
its a python bot that finds these people. it scans twitter and locating twitter influencers without being banned.
these influencers talk about ecerything: Sports, Politics, Cooking, Technology, Books and much much more.

here is an example of a twitter influencer found using the bot:

# The Output
The output of the program is 3 files that are actually 3 lists of influencers.
small influencers: <= 1k followers.
medium influencers: >= 1k  and <= 3k
"big" influencers: >= 3k  and <= 5k

here is a taste of the first 30:
